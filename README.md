# Personal Sandbox Website

This project is my first website, built as a sandbox to understand the basic components of web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Through this project, I experimented with various web development techniques and learned how different parts of a webpage work together.

- **HTML**: Basic structure, including headings, paragraphs, lists, forms, tables, and navigation.
- **CSS**: External stylesheet for simple styling, along with some inline styles for experimentation.
- **JavaScript**: Simple interactivity, including button click handling and form elements.

## What I Learned

- How to structure a webpage using HTML elements.
- The importance of linking external stylesheets and JavaScript files to HTML.
- Basic styling using inline and external CSS.
- Using JavaScript for simple DOM manipulation and event handling.
